 * the chances for receiving packets from neighbors (i.e., leads to higher
 * throughput), but also results in higher power consumption.
 * In LWMAC, by default, we regard the wake-up period as the beginning of a cycle.

 * LWMAC supports burst transmission based on the pending-bit technique, and this macro

 * procedure is as follow: 1) the sender first uses WR stream to locate the receiver's
 * wake-up period (if the sender has already phase-locked the receiver's phase, normally
 * the sender only cost one WR to get the first WA from the receiver) and then sends its
 * first data. 2) After the transmission of the first data, the sender immediately sends
 * a WR to the receiver for starting the second round of transmission of the second data.
 * The receiver should also immediately reply WA for continue receiving data packets. In
 * case the sender doesn't receive WA during LWMAC_TIME_BETWEEN_WR_US, it regards the
 * consecutive (burst) transmission failed and quits TX procedure (the data will be queued
 * back to the transmission queue for normal transmission attempt in following cycles).
 * 3) In case the second transmission succeeds, the sender repeats step-2 to send all the
 * following pending packets. In short, in burst transmission mode, the sender doesn't
 * tolerate no-WA event. ALl the pending data packets should be sent with only one WR cost for
 * leading the transmission.
